<objective>
Create grid/list view components for displaying player search results with view toggle.

Purpose: Give users flexible display options - compact list for scanning, detailed grid for browsing.
Output: PlayerCard and PlayerList components integrated with SearchBar.

# Key files from Phase 3:
@src/components/SearchBar.tsx
@src/app/api/search/route.ts

**Tech stack available:** Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS
**Established patterns:** Client components in src/components/, API routes in src/app/api/
**Constraining decisions:**
- [Phase 3]: JSON file as data source (no Supabase for search)
- [Phase 3]: 300ms debounce for search input
- [Phase 3]: Player interface: name, position, age, club, marketValue, nationality, url, playerId

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create PlayerCard component</name>
  <files>src/components/PlayerCard.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create a reusable PlayerCard component that displays a single player's information.

Structure:
- Accept Player type as prop (import from SearchBar or create shared types file)
- Display: name (bold, prominent), position, age, club, market value (green), nationality flags/text
- Use Tailwind CSS matching existing dark/light theme patterns from SearchBar
- Card style: rounded corners, subtle border, hover shadow effect
- Make the card clickable (for future Phase 6 player detail page) - use a wrapper div with cursor-pointer

Do NOT add click handler navigation yet - that's Phase 6. Just make it visually clickable.
  </action>
  <verify>TypeScript compiles without errors: `npm run build`</verify>
  <done>PlayerCard component exists, accepts Player prop, displays all key fields with consistent styling</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create PlayerList component with grid/list toggle</name>
  <files>src/components/PlayerList.tsx, src/components/SearchBar.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create PlayerList component that renders players in either grid or list layout.

PlayerList component:
- Props: players: Player[], viewMode: 'grid' | 'list'
- Grid mode: CSS grid, 1 col mobile, 2 cols tablet, 3 cols desktop (responsive)
- List mode: Compact single-column layout, less padding, more info density
- Use PlayerCard for grid, simpler row for list
- Empty state: "No players to display"

Add view toggle to SearchBar:
- Add viewMode state ('grid' | 'list'), default 'grid'
- Add toggle buttons (grid icon, list icon) above results
- Use simple SVG icons or Unicode characters (▦ for grid, ≡ for list)
- Pass viewMode to PlayerList
- Replace inline result rendering with PlayerList component

Keep the search input and results count display as-is.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `npm run build` succeeds
2. `npm run dev` - search works, toggle switches between views
  </verify>
  <done>
- PlayerList component renders players in grid/list modes
- SearchBar has working view toggle
- Grid shows 1/2/3 columns responsive
- List shows compact rows
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Before declaring phase complete:
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds without errors
- [ ] Search results display in both grid and list modes
- [ ] View toggle switches between modes
- [ ] Responsive layout works (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- [ ] Dark mode styling consistent
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- All tasks completed
- All verification checks pass
- No TypeScript errors
- Grid/list toggle works seamlessly
- PlayerCard reusable for future player detail integration
