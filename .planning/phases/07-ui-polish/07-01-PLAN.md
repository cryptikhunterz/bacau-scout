<objective>
Polish the UI with skeleton loading states, responsive improvements, and smooth animations.

Purpose: Deliver the "clean UX" that differentiates from competitors — scouts will pay for a tool that's enjoyable to use.
Output: Polished UI with professional loading states and smooth transitions.

# Key files to modify:
@src/components/SearchBar.tsx
@src/components/PlayerCard.tsx
@src/components/PlayerList.tsx
@src/components/FilterPanel.tsx
@src/app/player/[id]/page.tsx

**Tech stack available:** Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS (with transitions, transforms, animations)
**Established patterns:** Dark/light mode theming, transition-colors, max-w-4xl container
**Constraining decisions:**
- [Phase 4]: Grid/list toggle with Unicode symbols
- [Phase 5]: Collapsible filter panel with "Active" badge
- [Phase 6]: Player detail page with card-style sections

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add skeleton loading states for search results</name>
  <files>src/components/SearchBar.tsx, src/components/PlayerCard.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create skeleton loaders that appear while searching:

1. Create a SkeletonCard component in PlayerCard.tsx:
   - Match the PlayerCard layout (name, position/age, club, market value, nationality)
   - Use Tailwind's animate-pulse with bg-zinc-200 dark:bg-zinc-700 for skeleton bars
   - Slightly randomize widths (w-32, w-24, w-20) for natural look
   - Export separately: `export function SkeletonCard()`

2. Update SearchBar.tsx to show skeletons during loading:
   - Replace the "Searching..." text with 6 SkeletonCards in a grid
   - Use same grid layout as PlayerList (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2)
   - Show skeletons immediately when isLoading becomes true
   - Ensure smooth transition between skeletons and real results

Do NOT change the existing debounce timing or search behavior.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. npm run build succeeds
2. Search shows skeleton cards while loading (not text)
3. Skeletons match light/dark theme
4. Skeletons transition smoothly to real results
  </verify>
  <done>
- SkeletonCard component exists and matches PlayerCard layout
- SearchBar shows skeleton grid during loading
- Dark mode skeletons use zinc-700 backgrounds
- Build passes
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add entrance animations for search results</name>
  <files>src/components/PlayerList.tsx, src/components/PlayerCard.tsx</files>
  <action>
Add smooth entrance animations when results appear:

1. Add staggered fade-in animation to PlayerList:
   - Each card fades in with slight delay after the previous
   - Use CSS animation classes (not JS animation library)
   - Define keyframe animation in a style tag or inline Tailwind
   - Stagger: 50ms between cards (card 1: 0ms, card 2: 50ms, card 3: 100ms, etc.)
   - Max 10 cards animated, rest appear immediately (performance)

2. Add animation classes to PlayerCard wrapper:
   - opacity-0 initially, animate to opacity-100
   - Small translateY (translate-y-2 to translate-y-0) for subtle lift
   - Duration: 300ms, ease-out timing

3. Implementation approach using Tailwind arbitrary values:
   - Use inline style for animation-delay: `style={{ animationDelay: `${index * 50}ms` }}`
   - Add animation class that handles opacity and transform

Do NOT add any animation libraries (framer-motion, etc.). Use CSS only.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. npm run build succeeds
2. Search results fade in with staggered timing
3. Animation is subtle (not distracting)
4. Works in both grid and list view modes
  </verify>
  <done>
- Cards animate in with stagger effect
- Animation uses CSS only (no JS libraries)
- Works for both view modes
- Build passes
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Improve FilterPanel expand/collapse and mobile responsiveness</name>
  <files>src/components/FilterPanel.tsx, src/app/player/[id]/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Polish the filter panel animation and improve mobile layout:

1. FilterPanel smooth expand/collapse:
   - Add smooth height transition when toggling (currently instant)
   - Use grid-rows-[0fr] to grid-rows-[1fr] transition pattern for smooth height
   - Wrap filter content in overflow-hidden div
   - Duration: 200ms, ease-out

2. FilterPanel mobile improvements:
   - On mobile (sm:), stack filters in single column instead of 2-column grid
   - Increase touch targets: min-h-[44px] for inputs and selects
   - Add more vertical spacing between filter groups on mobile

3. Player detail page mobile improvements:
   - Stack stats grid on mobile: grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2
   - Add padding adjustments for smaller screens
   - Ensure back button is easily tappable (min touch target)

Keep existing dark/light theme styling intact.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. npm run build succeeds
2. Filter panel expands/collapses smoothly (not instant)
3. Filters stack properly on mobile viewport (375px)
4. Player detail page stats stack on mobile
5. Touch targets are adequately sized on mobile
  </verify>
  <done>
- FilterPanel has smooth height transition
- Mobile layout uses single column for filters
- Player detail stats stack on mobile
- All touch targets >= 44px height
- Build passes
  </done>
</task>
