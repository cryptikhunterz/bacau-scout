## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 1]: Project located at ~/Desktop/bacau-scout/ (create-next-app needs empty directory)
- [Phase 1]: Supabase anon key placeholder used (key needed from dashboard)
- [Phase 2]: Used TEXT id instead of UUID (matches TM player IDs)
- [Phase 2]: Service role key used for import (bypasses RLS)
- [Phase 2]: 576 players imported from 750 records (74 unknown format)
- [Phase 3]: JSON file as data source (MVP approach, no Supabase for search)
- [Phase 3]: 300ms debounce for search input
