## 🎬 Video Analysis (Frame-by-Frame Breakdown)

### Finishing Technique
- **Placement over power** — Consistently picks his spot rather than blasting. Goalkeepers are beaten by accuracy, not pace.
- **Composure under pressure** — Multiple goals scored in tight situations (trailing, away, late-game). No panic in front of goal.
- **Shot selection** — Takes high-percentage shots from inside the box. Not a speculative shooter.

### Positioning & Movement
- **Central striker who gravitates to danger zones** — Consistently found between the posts at the moment of delivery.
- **Penalty box presence** — Natural poacher's instinct to be in the right place.
- **Separation from defenders** — Creates 1-2m of daylight through timing rather than physical dominance. Uses body feints and check-away movements.
- **Attacks space rather than occupying it early** — Defenders react to his movement rather than tracking him proactively.

### Body Shape
- **Open body orientation** when receiving — allows him to see the goal and play forward.
- **Low center of gravity** on strikes — controlled, planted finishing technique.
- **Angled body shape** to open up far-post finishes.

### Physical Profile
- **Lean, athletic build** — Mobile striker, not a target man.
- **Strong endurance** — Dangerous in the final 15 minutes (multiple late goals).
- **Pace to run channels** — Movement-based rather than hold-up play.

### Mental Profile
- **Scores when trailing** — Doesn't switch off when the team is behind.
- **Takes penalties confidently** — 3/3 conversion suggests nerve and self-belief.
- **Passionate celebrations** — Genuine emotional investment in scoring.
- **Available at 85+ minutes** — Physical and mental stamina.

## 🔗 Flavius Teaching Points Assessment

### 1. Striker Separation ✅
Creates daylight between himself and defenders through timing and intelligent movement rather than physical strength. Multiple goals show defenders flat-footed and reactive.

### 2. Double Movement ✅
Evidence of check-away movements before attacking deliveries. Defensive lines consistently disorganized at the moment of his goals.

### 3. Body Shape ✅
Open body orientation when finishing. Shapes to place the ball rather than snatch at chances.

### 4. Ball Watching ⚠️
Need more defensive-phase footage to assess. No evidence of switching off when team is in possession.

### 5. Clearance Direction N/A
Not applicable — he's a striker.
