## Season 2025/26 Statistics (Transfermarkt)
| Competition | Apps | Goals | Assists | Minutes |
|-------------|------|-------|---------|---------|
| **CFL (Czech 3rd tier)** | 6 | 0 | 2 | 396' |
| **UECL Qualifiers** | 2 | 0 | 0 | 31' |
| **Eesti Karikas** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 90' |
| **Chance Liga** | 0 (not in squad 8 times) | 0 | 0 | 0' |
| **Total** | 9 | 0 | 2 | 517' |

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CONCERN: Position Mismatch
**Suso is listed as a Left Winger, NOT a Centre-Forward.** While he was included as a "striker target," his primary and secondary positions are Left Winger and Right Winger. This is a significant mismatch for FC Bacău's needs if they specifically need a central striker.

## Wyscout Analysis ⚠️ PARTIAL — VIDEO RESTRICTED
**Platform:** Wyscout (Hudl) — Player profile accessible, video clips RESTRICTED
**Date Reviewed:** 17/02/2026

**All goals from Estonian football (Paide + Paide II):**
| # | Foot | Minute | Match | Score | Date |

| 1 | Right | 13:28 | Paide vs Tallinna Kalev | 2-2 | 09/08/2025 |
| 2 | Right | 78:48 | Paide vs Levadia | 2-1 | 23/04/2025 |

| 9 | Right | 56:21 | Paide II vs FCI Levadia II | 3-1 | 13/07/2024 |

**Foot distribution:** 5 Right, 3 Left, 1 Header → two-footed despite left-foot preference
**Patterns:** Scores braces regularly (3 brace matches); most goals vs lower-quality Estonian teams
**Note:** Despite Wyscout listing foot as "Left," he scores more with his right foot

### Video Categories Available on Wyscout (different from Van der Leij)
His Events List includes: Crosses, Off the ball movements, Throw-ins — confirming **wide player profile** (not striker)

## Key Concerns
1. **ZERO goals** this season across all competitions
2. **Not making the Chance Liga squad** — listed "Not in squad" for 8 consecutive matchdays
3. **Playing only in the CFL** (Czech 3rd tier reserve league) with Pardubice B
4. **Minimal European experience** — 31 minutes across 2 UECL qualifier matches with Paide
5. **Only 517 total minutes** this season — barely playing
6. **Position mismatch** — Winger, not striker

## Career Path Analysis
- Came from Estonia (Paide Linnameeskond) via UECL qualifiers
- Loaned/transferred to FK Pardubice but not breaking into the first team
- Playing reserve team football at age 20 — not a positive trajectory
- Joined Pardubice on 08/09/2025 — very recent

## Scouting Assessment (Flavius Criteria)

### Separation Ability — CANNOT ASSESS (no video, no goals)
### Double Movement — CANNOT ASSESS
### Body Shape — Left-footed winger, wide player profile
### Finishing Technique — POOR (0 goals in 9 appearances)
### Movement Patterns — CANNOT ASSESS
### Hold-Up Play — NOT APPLICABLE (winger profile)

## Strengths
1. **Young** — 20 years old, still developing
2. **Left-footed winger** — rare profile, useful if formation needs wide players
3. **2 assists** — shows some creative ability
4. **Market value low** — €150k, affordable
5. **Agent** — David Moss Group handles the relationship

## Weaknesses
1. **ZERO goals** — not a goalscorer
2. **Not a striker** — position mismatch
3. **Can't break into Pardubice first team** — quality concern
4. **Limited minutes** — only 517' all season
5. **No Chance Liga appearances** — not trusted at Czech top-flight level
6. **Gambian passport** — may need work permit/non-EU slot in Romania

## Verdict: ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED

**Suso should be removed from the striker shortlist.** He is a winger with zero goals who cannot break into a mid-table Czech first division side. He does not meet the profile FC Bacău needs for a centre-forward signing.

**If FC Bacău needs a wide player**, Suso could be reconsidered, but even then his output (0 goals, 2 assists in 517 minutes) is underwhelming.

## PRAISE Salary Estimate

| Factor | Assessment | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **P** (Position) | LW — Left Winger (not FW) | Position mismatch |
| **R** (Rating) | 0 goals, 2 assists in 9 apps | Very poor → minimum band |
| **A** (Age) | 20 | Young but not producing |
| **S** (Signing) | Contract unclear | Likely available cheaply |
| **E** (Experience) | Czech 3rd tier, Estonian league | Very low level |

**Estimated Monthly Salary Range:** €1,500 – €2,500/month
**Estimated Transfer Fee:** Free – €15,000
**Recommendation:** PASS
