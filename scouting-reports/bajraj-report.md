## Frame-by-Frame Analysis

### Clip 1: vs Ilirija (39:16) — Left Foot Goal
- **Screenshot:** `bajraj-goal1-ilirija.png`
- **Context:** Beltinci leading 2-0, Bajraj makes a run into the box from a slightly deeper position
- **Observation:** Shows good penalty box instinct, arriving at the right moment. Body positioned side-on to the defender, low centre of gravity. Clean left-foot finish.

### Clip 4: vs Jesenice (08:50) — Header Goal (Hat-trick game)
- **Screenshot:** `bajraj-goal4-header-jesenice.png`
- **Context:** BEL 0-0 JES, early in the match. Cross delivered from the right side.
- **Observation:** Bajraj attacks the near post area with a well-timed run. Despite only 27.3% aerial duel win rate, shows he can convert headed chances when the delivery is good. Scored a **hat-trick** in this match (goals at 8:50, 32:40, 52:01) in just 60 minutes of play.

### Clip 9: vs Dravinja (00:53) — Early Left Foot Goal
- **Screenshot:** `bajraj-goal9-early-dravinja.png`
- **Context:** Scored within the first minute of the match away from home.
- **Observation:** Shows predatory sharpness — already alert and making runs from kick-off. Good initial positioning in the box to receive a pass from the right channel. Composed left-foot finish.

## Scouting Assessment (Flavius Criteria)

### ✅ Separation Ability — GOOD
- Uses his 185cm frame to create space physically but also shows clever movement off the ball
- 2.97 dribbles/90 with 58.8% success rate suggests he can drive at defenders
- Regularly finds pockets in the penalty area

### ✅ Double Movement — MODERATE
- Evidence from clips shows he makes initial feints before committing to runs
- Goal at 00:53 vs Dravinja shows immediate alertness and pre-planned movement
- Penalty box movement patterns suggest he understands decoy runs

### ✅ Body Shape When Receiving — GOOD
- Open body shape visible in Clip 1 (vs Ilirija) — positioned side-on
- Low centre of gravity for a 185cm player
- Uses arms for balance and to hold off defenders

### ✅ Finishing Technique — EXCELLENT
- **12 goals in 16 games** = elite conversion at this level
- Predominantly left-footed (12/18 career goals with left foot) but can score with right foot (3 goals) and head (1 goal)
- Takes and converts penalties reliably (5 penalty goals across the clip list)
- Goal variety: open play, penalties, headers — complete finisher
- 52.5% shot accuracy is solid

### ✅ Movement Patterns — VERY GOOD
- Hat-trick vs Jesenice shows sustained, intelligent movement across 60 minutes
- Early goal vs Dravinja (00:53) demonstrates explosive penalty box runs
- Consistently finds space between defenders

### ⚠️ Hold-Up Play — NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
- 37.5% duel success rate is concerning for a CF
- 27.3% aerial duel success is poor for a 185cm striker
- Only 68.3% pass accuracy suggests limitations when receiving under pressure
- Zero assists across all games — needs to improve link-up play

## Strengths
1. **Prolific goal scorer** — 12 in 16 at 2. SNL level (0.75 goals/game)
2. **Versatile** — can score with left foot, right foot, and head
3. **Penalty taker** — reliable from the spot
4. **Disciplinary record** — 0 yellow, 0 red cards in 16 matches
5. **Goal variety** — scores in big moments (early goals, hat-tricks)
6. **Age profile** — 25 years old, entering prime years

## Weaknesses/Concerns
1. **Level of competition** — Slovenia 2. SNL is a very low level; these stats may not translate
2. **Aerial weakness** — 27.3% aerial duel win rate is poor for 185cm
3. **Zero assists** — no creative output; purely a finisher
4. **Duel winning** — 37.5% overall duel success rate is below average
5. **No contract info** — could be a free agent or on a short-term deal
6. **No agent** — negotiations would be direct with player/club
7. **Goal-dependent** — limited contribution outside of scoring

## Verdict: RECOMMENDED — Budget Striker Signing

**Bajraj should be considered as a primary target for FC Bacău.** His goal record at Slovenia 2. SNL level (comparable to Romania Liga 2 level) is outstanding. The concern is whether his output translates to a marginally higher standard, but at €175k market value, the risk/reward ratio is excellent.

**Recommended Action:** Schedule a live scouting trip to verify in-person. If physical attributes and hold-up play look serviceable live, move to negotiate.

## PRAISE Salary Estimate

| Factor | Assessment | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **P** (Position) | FW — Centre-Forward | Premium position, slightly higher salary band |

| **S** (Signing) | Likely free agent or cheap buyout (no contract info) | **Low acquisition cost** |
| **E** (Experience) | Slovenia 2. SNL only | Lower league → moderate salary expectation |

**Estimated Monthly Salary Range:** €2,500 – €4,000/month
**Estimated Transfer Fee:** Free – €25,000 (depending on contract situation)
**Total Annual Cost:** €30,000 – €48,000
