**Foot distribution (senior goals):** 7 Right, 4 Left, 2 Headers → **genuinely two-footed**
**Timing pattern:** 8 of 12 goals scored after 65th minute → **impact sub / late-game predator**

### Video Observations (Clip-by-Clip)

**Goal 1 vs TOP Oss (79:18, Right Foot):**
- Central positioning inside the penalty area, ~10-12 yards from goal
- Good body alignment — open stance, facing goal, balanced at moment of strike
- Found space between defensive lines; defenders disorganised
- Multiple RKC players in box = structured build-up, not counter-attack
- Shows **predatory instinct** to arrive at the right moment in the danger zone

**Goal 3 vs Utrecht II (19:00, Right Foot):**
- Made it 2-0 from a well-worked team move
- Positioned centrally in the box, waiting for the delivery
- Celebration footage showed confidence and composure

**Goal 5 vs HSC '21 (42:16, Left Foot, KNVB Beker):**
- Positioned in **left half-space** of the penalty area
- Open body shape pre-set to receive on his left foot — shows **anticipatory body orientation**
- Low centre of gravity, balanced stance before striking
- Scored 3 goals in this match (14', 42', 44') — two-minute gap between goals 5 and 6 (header)
- Cup opposition but still demonstrates finishing composure and ability to score in variety of ways

### Key Insights from Video
1. **Genuinely two-footed:** Rare quality — scores comfortably with both feet AND headers
2. **Late-game specialist:** Most goals come after 65th minute — suggests he's either subbed on as impact player or maintains fitness/sharpness late
3. **Average 41.1 min/match with 9 league goals:** This is an extraordinary goals-per-minute ratio (one goal per ~100 minutes of league play)
4. **Movement intelligence:** Consistently finds pockets of space between defensive lines
5. **Body shape awareness:** Pre-sets body position to receive onto preferred foot for each situation
6. **No panic in the box:** Composed at the point of finishing — doesn't rush or snatch at chances
7. **Versatile goal-scoring:** Right foot, left foot, headers, early goals, late goals — complete striker profile

## Key Statistical Highlights
- **12 senior goals across league and cup** — exceptional for a 19-year-old
- **Brace vs Utrecht II** (right foot + left foot in same game) — two-footed demonstrated in match context
- **Hat-trick vs HSC '21** (left foot + left foot + header in 30 minutes) — clinical finishing
- **3 assists** — more creative output than Bajraj
- Came through **PSV and Vitesse youth systems** — Dutch academy pedigree
- **KNVB Beker goals** vs higher-level opposition

## Scouting Assessment (Flavius Criteria)

### Separation Ability — ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) GOOD
- Video shows consistent ability to find pockets of space between defensive lines
- Positions himself intelligently between CBs, exploiting gaps
- Not a pace-merchant; uses movement intelligence rather than raw speed to create separation
- Arrives late into box positions where defenders have already committed

### Double Movement — ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) GOOD
- Dutch academy training (PSV, Vitesse) evident in off-ball movement patterns
- Late-game goals (8 of 12 after 65') suggest he reads defensive fatigue and exploits timing runs
- Brace vs Utrecht II and hat-trick vs HSC '21 show repeated ability to find space within the same match

### Body Shape — ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) EXCELLENT
- **Genuinely two-footed** — 7 right, 4 left, 2 headers across senior goals
- Pre-sets body orientation before receiving to open shooting angles
- Open stance facing goal at point of strike — not turning/adjusting
- Anticipatory positioning: adjusts body to receive onto the optimal foot for each situation
- This is a rare and extremely valuable quality at his age

### Finishing Technique — ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) EXCELLENT
- Two-footed finishing with headers = complete striker finishing profile
- Composed in the box — doesn't rush shots or snatch at chances
- 1 goal per ~100 minutes of league play at age 19 in Dutch 2nd division
- Scores in variety of situations: early goals (5'), late goals (89', 91'), from crosses, through-balls
- Brace in same game with different feet demonstrates technical versatility

### Movement Patterns — ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) EXCELLENT
- Consistent central positioning in the danger zone (between 6-yard and penalty spot)
- Predatory box movement — arrives at the right place at the right time
- Impact sub profile: 41.1 min/match average yet scores consistently = immediate engagement
- Found space vs Utrecht II, TOP Oss, Cambuur, Dordrecht — different defensive setups
- Two-minute gap between Goals 5 and 6 (42:16 + 44:16) shows sustained alertness in the box

### Hold-Up Play — ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) MODERATE (limited evidence)
- Video clips focus on goals (final action) — limited footage of build-up play
- 3 assists suggest some ability to combine with teammates
- Need full match footage to properly assess link-up play and hold-up ability
- At 19 with no listed height/weight, physical profile for hold-up unclear

## Strengths
1. **Age** — Only 19, massive development potential and resale value
2. **Dutch academy pedigree** — PSV and Vitesse youth training
3. **Proven at higher level** — Dutch 2nd division is stronger than Slovenia/Czech 2nd tier
4. **Goal-scoring consistency** — 13 goals in 25 apps
5. **Cup performances** — Scores vs higher-level opposition
6. **Impact sub ability** — Can score from the bench

## Weaknesses/Concerns
1. **Contract until 2028** — RKC will demand a significant fee; no cheap deal
2. **Market value €275k** — Most expensive target on the shortlist
3. **Agent situation unclear** — No agency (Wyscout) vs YOUrs S&A (TM) — conflicting info
4. **Impact sub profile** — 41.1 min/match avg; hasn't fully established as a starter yet
5. **Step down** — Moving from Netherlands to Romania would be a step down; motivation concern
6. **Physical profile unknown** — Height/weight not listed; hold-up play unassessed
7. **Late-game goals concentration** — Scores mostly vs tired defences; performance vs fresh backlines needs monitoring

## Verdict: 🔴 HIGH-PRIORITY TARGET — VIDEO CONFIRMS QUALITY

**Wyscout video analysis CONFIRMS** van der Leij is the **highest ceiling player** on this shortlist. The footage reveals a genuinely two-footed striker with exceptional body shape awareness and finishing composure that is rare for a 19-year-old.

**Key video takeaway:** His goals-per-minute ratio (1 per ~100 min) combined with two-footed finishing and aerial ability makes him a **complete striker profile** at just 19. The Dutch 2nd division is significantly stronger than Liga II or the Czech/Slovenian 2nd divisions.

**Recommended Action:** 
1. ✅ Wyscout video reviewed — quality confirmed
2. Open discussions with RKC for a **loan with option to buy**
3. This is a **resale play** — sign at €200-300k, develop, sell at €500k+
4. Prioritise watching a full match (RKC vs Roda JC or TOP Oss) for hold-up play assessment
5. Clarify agent situation before negotiations
