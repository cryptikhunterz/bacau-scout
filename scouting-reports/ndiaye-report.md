## Loan Situation Analysis
- **On loan from FC Zlín** to Slezsky FC Opava
- Zlín contract expires 31/12/2026 — so he has ~10 months left on parent club contract
- If FC Bacău wants him permanently, they'd negotiate with **FC Zlín** (parent club)
- Alternatively, wait until December 2026 when he's free — but that's too late for this window
- A mid-season or summer 2026 move would require agreement from both Zlín and Opava

## Scouting Assessment (Flavius Criteria)

### Separation Ability — LIKELY GOOD
- 190cm frame gives him a physical advantage in lower leagues
- 5 goals in 9 starts shows he can find space

### Double Movement — UNKNOWN (no video reviewed)
- Czech 2nd division defenders are physically capable; his goals suggest movement quality

### Body Shape — STRONG PHYSICAL PROFILE
- 190cm / 6'3" right-footed
- Versatile — can play CF, RW, Second Striker
- Size suggests good hold-up and aerial presence

### Finishing Technique — GOOD
- Hat-trick shows composure (3 goals in one match = different finishing types)
- Late winner vs Baník Ostrava B (90+2') shows penalty box instinct

### Movement Patterns — GOOD
- Versatile positional play (CF, RW, SS) suggests intelligent movement
- Scores in different areas of the pitch

### Hold-Up Play — LIKELY STRONG
- 190cm, right-footed CF — natural hold-up player profile
- Starts most games and plays 84+ minutes — trusted by coaches

## Strengths
1. **Physical profile** — 190cm, strong, imposing centre-forward
2. **Proven at Czech 2nd division** — higher level than Slovenia 2. SNL
3. **Versatile** — CF, RW, Second Striker
4. **Regular starter** — averaging 85 min/game, clearly trusted
5. **Hat-trick capability** — can dominate matches
6. **Experienced** — 26 years old, knows multiple leagues
7. **Late goals** — 90+2' winner shows persistence
8. **Reasonable price** — €200k market value, Zlín contract ending soon

## Weaknesses
1. **Red card/discipline** — recorded suspension, potential temperament issue
2. **On loan** — complicated transfer structure (Zlín + Opava)
3. **Senegalese passport** — non-EU, requires work permit/foreign slot
4. **Age** — 26 is prime but not young; no resale value
5. **Career trajectory** — still in 2nd division at 26; hasn't broken through to top flight
6. **Only 5 goals in 9 starts** — good but not exceptional
7. **No Wyscout video reviewed** — need to confirm on film

## Verdict: STRONG OPTION — Second Priority After Bajraj

Ndiaye is a **reliable, physical centre-forward** with proven output in the Czech 2nd division. His profile (190cm, versatile, experienced) is exactly what FC Bacău might need for Liga 2. The complicated loan structure and non-EU status are the main obstacles.

**Recommended Action:**
1. Contact FC Zlín about permanent transfer — contract expires 31/12/2026, so leverage is good
2. Verify non-EU player slot availability for Romanian Liga 2
3. Request Wyscout video for Czech ChNL matches
4. Target a summer 2026 transfer when the Opava loan ends

## PRAISE Salary Estimate

| Factor | Assessment | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **P** (Position) | FW — Centre-Forward | Premium |

| **S** (Signing) | On loan from Zlín, contract Dec 2026 | Moderate fee, ~€50-100k |

**Estimated Monthly Salary Range:** €3,000 – €5,000/month
**Estimated Transfer Fee:** €50,000 – €100,000 (Zlín motivated to sell before contract expires)
**Total Annual Cost:** €36,000 – €60,000 salary + fee
