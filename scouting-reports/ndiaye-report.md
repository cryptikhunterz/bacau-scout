## Loan Situation Analysis
- **On loan from FC Zlín** to Slezsky FC Opava
- Zlín contract expires 31/12/2026 — so he has ~10 months left on parent club contract
- If FC Bacău wants him permanently, they'd negotiate with **FC Zlín** (parent club)
- Alternatively, wait until December 2026 when he's free — but that's too late for this window
- A mid-season or summer 2026 move would require agreement from both Zlín and Opava

### Wyscout Heat Map Observations
- Primary positioning in **central forward zones** — classic number 9
- Secondary heat in **wide right areas** — confirms versatility to drift right
- Strong presence in **both penalty boxes** — suggests defensive set-piece involvement too

## Scouting Assessment (Flavius Criteria)

### Separation Ability — ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) MODERATE (video not reviewed)
- 190cm frame gives physical advantage in lower leagues
- 5 goals in 9 starts shows he can find space
- Limited footage to confirm movement quality in open play

### Double Movement — ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) MODERATE (inferred from data)
- Hat-trick shows ability to find different scoring positions within same match
- Goals from both feet and head suggest varied finishing positions

### Body Shape — ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) STRONG PHYSICAL PROFILE
- **190cm / 6'3", 77kg** — imposing centre-forward frame
- Right-footed primary, capable in the air
- Versatile — can play CF, RW, Second Striker
- Size-to-weight ratio suggests athletic rather than just tall

### Finishing Technique — ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) GOOD
- Hat-trick confirmed via Wyscout: right foot × 2 + header in same match
- 5 goals in 763 minutes = 1 goal per 152 minutes
- Scores in both halves, from different situations
- Late winner vs Baník Ostrava B (90+2') shows penalty box instinct

### Movement Patterns — ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) GOOD
- Versatile positional play (CF/RW/SS) suggests intelligent movement
- CF in every match this season — coach trusts him centrally
- Heat map shows central + right drift pattern
- 84.8 min/match average — full 90 trusted

### Hold-Up Play — ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) LIKELY STRONG
- 190cm, right-footed CF — natural hold-up player profile
- Starts virtually every game and plays near-full 90 — trusted by coaches
- Video needed to confirm but physical profile strongly suggests capability

## Strengths
1. **Physical profile** — 190cm, strong, imposing centre-forward
2. **Proven at Czech 2nd division** — higher level than Slovenia 2. SNL
3. **Versatile** — CF, RW, Second Striker
4. **Regular starter** — averaging 85 min/game, clearly trusted
5. **Hat-trick capability** — can dominate matches
6. **Experienced** — 26 years old, knows multiple leagues
7. **Late goals** — 90+2' winner shows persistence
8. **Reasonable price** — €200k market value, Zlín contract ending soon

## Weaknesses
1. **Red card/discipline** — red card at 41' vs Táborsko (01/11/2025); 2 yellows + 1 red in 9 games = discipline concern
2. **On loan** — complicated transfer structure (Zlín owns, Opava loans)
3. **Senegalese passport** — non-EU, requires work permit/foreign slot in Romania
4. **Age** — 26 is prime but not young; no resale value
5. **Career trajectory** — still in 2nd division at 26; hasn't broken through to Czech top flight
6. **Wyscout video RESTRICTED** — subscription doesn't cover Czech CNL; cannot confirm technical qualities on film
7. **Agent discrepancy** — "No agency" on Wyscout vs "Daniel Chrysostome" on Transfermarkt

## Verdict: STRONG OPTION — Second Priority After Bajraj

Ndiaye is a **reliable, physical centre-forward** with proven output in the Czech 2nd division. His profile (190cm, versatile, experienced) is exactly what FC Bacău might need for Liga 2. The complicated loan structure and non-EU status are the main obstacles.

**Recommended Action:**
1. Contact FC Zlín about permanent transfer — contract expires 31/12/2026, so leverage is good
2. Verify non-EU player slot availability for Romanian Liga 2
3. Request Wyscout video for Czech ChNL matches
4. Target a summer 2026 transfer when the Opava loan ends

## PRAISE Salary Estimate

| Factor | Assessment | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **P** (Position) | FW — Centre-Forward | Premium |
| **R** (Rating) | 5 goals + 1 assist in 9 apps | Solid → mid-upper band |
| **A** (Age) | 26 | Prime but no resale → fair value |
| **S** (Signing) | On loan from Zlín, contract Dec 2026 | Moderate fee, ~€50-100k |
| **E** (Experience) | Czech 2nd division, multiple clubs | Reasonable salary expectation |

**Estimated Monthly Salary Range:** €3,000 – €5,000/month
**Estimated Transfer Fee:** €50,000 – €100,000 (Zlín motivated to sell before contract expires)
**Total Annual Cost:** €36,000 – €60,000 salary + fee
