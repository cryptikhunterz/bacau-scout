|-------------|------|-------|---------|---------|
| **Druga Liga (2. SNL)** | 12 | 5 | 3 | 559' |

- **Plays in same league as Bajraj** (2. SNL) — direct comparison possible
- Joined Brinje Grosuplje from NK Domžale where he was NOT in squad for 7 consecutive 1. SNL matches
- Short playing times suggest rotation/substitute role (avg ~50 min/game)
- **Cup hero**: Beat NK Maribor 5-3 on penalties (1st round), beat Kety Bistrica 2-1 AET (Round of 16)

## Notable Matches
| Date | Match | Competition | Result | Minutes | Goals |
|------|-------|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 04/10/2025 | Brinje vs NK Krško | 2. SNL | 5-0 | 29' | 1 (+45' yellow) |
| 19/09/2025 | Brinje vs ND Dravinja | 2. SNL | 2-1 | 31' | 1 |

## Comparison with Bajraj (Same League)
| Metric | Černe | Bajraj |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Apps** | 12 | 16 |
| **Goals** | 5 | 12 |
| **Assists** | 3 | 0 |
| **Minutes** | 559' | 1,037' |
| **Goals/90** | 0.81 | 1.04 |
| **Goal+Assist/90** | 1.29 | 1.04 |
| **Min/Game** | 46.6 | 64.8 |

**Analysis:** Černe has a better combined G+A per 90 (1.29 vs 1.04) than Bajraj, but in significantly fewer minutes and mostly as a substitute. Bajraj is the clear starter-quality player.

## Scouting Assessment (Flavius Criteria)

### Finishing Technique — GOOD
- 5 goals from limited minutes suggests clinical finishing
- Goals concentrated in specific matches (not spread evenly)

### Movement Patterns — PROMISING
- Coming off the bench and scoring suggests good impact movement
- Finds space quickly when introduced

### Hold-Up Play — UNKNOWN
- Limited minutes make assessment difficult

### ⚠️ Red Flag: Playing Time
- Average of 46.6 minutes per game suggests he's not trusted for 90 minutes
- Previously couldn't make the NK Domžale 1. SNL squad at all
- Dropped to 2. SNL for playing time at age 21

## Strengths
1. **Age** — 21, good development years ahead
2. **Goals + Assists** — 8 G+A in 697 minutes = 1.03 per 90
3. **Impact substitute** — can change games from the bench
4. **Slovenian EU passport** — no work permit issues
5. **Cup experience** — helped beat NK Maribor (1. SNL side)
6. **Same league as Bajraj** — direct comparison available

## Weaknesses
1. **Limited minutes** — cannot hold down a starting spot
2. **Dropped from 1. SNL** — NK Domžale didn't want him
3. **No contract info** — uncertain situation
4. **No agent** — unrepresented, direct negotiation needed
5. **Small sample size** — 5 goals in short bursts, may not sustain
6. **Lower goal output than Bajraj** in same league

## Verdict: BACKUP OPTION — Worth monitoring

Černe is an interesting **backup option** if Bajraj falls through. His G+A rate per 90 is actually slightly better, but the small sample size and inability to hold down a starting place are concerning. At 21, he should be a regular starter at 2. SNL level.

**Recommended Action:** Monitor through the spring season. If he earns regular starts and maintains his goal rate, consider a low-cost approach. Not a primary target.

## PRAISE Salary Estimate

| Factor | Assessment | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **P** (Position) | FW — Centre-Forward | Standard |
| **R** (Rating) | 5 goals + 3 assists in 697 min | Moderate output |
| **A** (Age) | 21 | Good development profile |
| **S** (Signing) | No contract info, no agent | Likely very cheap |
| **E** (Experience) | Slovenia 2. SNL (substitute) | Lower expectation |

**Estimated Monthly Salary Range:** €2,000 – €3,500/month
**Estimated Transfer Fee:** Free – €20,000
**Total Annual Cost:** €24,000 – €42,000
