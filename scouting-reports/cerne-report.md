| # | Foot | Minute | Match | Score | Date |
|---|------|--------|-------|-------|------|
| 1 | Left | 20:32 | Brinje-Grosuplje vs Bilje | 3-0 | 14/11/2025 |

| 4 | Left | 48:55 | Brinje-Grosuplje vs Bistrica | 2-0 | 02/11/2025 |

**Foot distribution:** 2 Left, 1 Right, 1 Header → **mostly left-footed but can use right + head**
**Brace habit:** 2 braces in 4 visible goals — scores in pairs when he's on

### Video Observations

**Goal 1 vs Bilje (20:32, Left Foot):**
- Set-piece situation — corner kick or deep delivery into the box
- Černe positioned himself in the **6-yard box** among a cluster of ~10 players
- Got a left-foot finish (possibly toe-poke/prod) from close range in traffic
- Shows **predatory instinct** — willingness to be in the danger zone
- Anticipation of second ball/knockdown from set-piece delivery

**Goal 2 vs Bilje (51:58, Right Foot):**
- Scored with his weaker right foot in the same game
- Shows he's not one-dimensional despite being left-footed

**Goal 3 vs Bistrica (45:17, Header):**
- Headed goal right before half-time — good timing
- Shows aerial ability

**Goal 4 vs Bistrica (48:55, Left Foot):**
- Scored 3 minutes into second half after heading the first
- Two quick goals = predatory instinct when confidence is high

### Key Wyscout Discovery: ⚠️ CONTRACT EXPIRES 30/06/2025
- Wyscout shows contract expiry as **30/06/2025** — this means he may already be **out of contract** or on an extension
- If out of contract → **FREE TRANSFER** opportunity
- This needs urgent verification

### Previous Matches (Wyscout)
| Date | Match | Comp | Result | Position | Minutes |
|------|-------|------|--------|----------|---------|
| 21/11/2025 | Brinje-Grosuplje vs Beltinci | 2. SNL | 1-0 | SS | 88' |
| 14/11/2025 | Brinje-Grosuplje vs Bilje | 2. SNL | 3-0 | CF | 83' |
| 09/11/2025 | Nafta vs Brinje-Grosuplje | 2. SNL | 1-1 | SS | 85' |

**Note:** Recent matches show 83-88 minutes = getting **more starting time**

## Scouting Assessment (Flavius Criteria)

### Finishing Technique — ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) GOOD
- 5 goals from limited minutes = clinical finisher
- Scores with left foot, right foot, AND headers — versatile
- Braces in consecutive appearances show consistency when given starts
- Set-piece danger — positions well in the 6-yard box

### Movement Patterns — ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) PROMISING
- Positions well inside the box for set-pieces
- Arriving late to dangerous positions
- Limited open-play footage to fully assess off-ball movement
- Coming off bench and scoring = good immediate engagement

### Separation Ability — ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) MODERATE
- Finds space in congested set-piece situations
- Limited evidence of space creation in open play
- 2. SNL defending is not a high bar

### Hold-Up Play — ⭐⭐ (2/5) UNKNOWN/LIMITED
- Limited minutes make assessment difficult
- No hold-up play visible in goal clips

### Body Shape — ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) MODERATE
- Left-footed primary, but can finish with right and head
- Opens body to create angles in the box
- Low centre of gravity observed in set-piece goals

### ⚠️ Red Flag: Playing Time (IMPROVING)
- Average of 46.3 minutes per game but **recent matches show 83-88 min starts**
- Previously couldn't make the NK Domžale 1. SNL squad at all
- Appears to be earning more trust at Brinje → trajectory is positive

## Strengths
1. **Age** — 21, good development years ahead
2. **Goals + Assists** — 8 G+A in 697 minutes = 1.03 per 90
3. **Impact substitute** — can change games from the bench
4. **Slovenian EU passport** — no work permit issues
5. **Cup experience** — helped beat NK Maribor (1. SNL side)
6. **Same league as Bajraj** — direct comparison available

## Weaknesses
1. **Limited minutes** — cannot hold down a starting spot
2. **Dropped from 1. SNL** — NK Domžale didn't want him
3. **No contract info** — uncertain situation
4. **No agent** — unrepresented, direct negotiation needed
5. **Small sample size** — 5 goals in short bursts, may not sustain
6. **Lower goal output than Bajraj** in same league

## Verdict: BACKUP OPTION — Worth monitoring

Černe is an interesting **backup option** if Bajraj falls through. His G+A rate per 90 is actually slightly better, but the small sample size and inability to hold down a starting place are concerning. At 21, he should be a regular starter at 2. SNL level.

**Recommended Action:** Monitor through the spring season. If he earns regular starts and maintains his goal rate, consider a low-cost approach. Not a primary target.

## PRAISE Salary Estimate

| Factor | Assessment | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **P** (Position) | FW — Centre-Forward | Standard |
| **R** (Rating) | 5 goals + 3 assists in 697 min | Moderate output |
| **A** (Age) | 21 | Good development profile |
| **S** (Signing) | No contract info, no agent | Likely very cheap |
| **E** (Experience) | Slovenia 2. SNL (substitute) | Lower expectation |

**Estimated Monthly Salary Range:** €2,000 – €3,500/month
**Estimated Transfer Fee:** Free – €20,000
**Total Annual Cost:** €24,000 – €42,000
