# Changelog

## 2026-02-12 (v9) — Radar Charts on Report View

### Added
- **Radar charts on report view page** (`/report/[playerId]`) — Two side-by-side radar/spider charts now appear above the attribute sections when viewing saved reports:
  - **Position Web (left, green #22c55e):** Shows average score per attribute group
  - **Overall Traits (right, blue #3b82f6):** Same data with different color for visual contrast
- **Handles both data formats:**
  - New system (positionAttributes): Computes group averages from position-specific template groups (up to 6 axes)
  - Legacy reports (Physical/Technique/Tactic only): Derives 3 axes from category averages
- **Position-specific attribute display:** Reports with positionAttributes now show attributes in a 2-column grid grouped by position template categories (e.g. Defensive Actions, Offensive Actions, Physical, etc.) with Roman numeral headers

### Changed
- **Improved attribute layout on report view:** Position-specific attributes render in a balanced 2-column grid (desktop) / single column (mobile); legacy attributes remain in their original 3-column layout

## 2026-02-12 (v8) — Radar Charts & Layout

### Added
- **Radar/Spider Charts on Scouting Report** — Two SVG-based radar charts displayed side by side above the attribute sections
  - **Position Web (left, green):** Shows average score per attribute group (e.g. Defensive Actions, Offensive Actions, Physical, Technical, Tactical, Mental) on a 1-5 scale
  - **Overall Traits (right, blue):** Same category breakdown with a different color for visual contrast
  - Charts update in real-time as the scout changes attribute ratings
- **`RadarChart` reusable component** (`src/components/RadarChart.tsx`) — Pure SVG radar chart with configurable labels, values, maxValue, color, fillOpacity, title, and size
  - Concentric grid polygons with axis lines
  - Filled data polygon with dot markers
  - Value labels at each data point, outer text labels for each axis
  - Scale labels along the first axis
  - Dark theme styling (zinc-700 grid, zinc-300/500 labels)

### Changed
- **Symmetrical 2-column attribute layout** — The 6 attribute groups now render in a 2-column grid on desktop (3 groups per column), single column on mobile
- **Radar charts responsive** — Stack vertically on mobile, side by side on desktop

## 2026-02-12 (v7) — Bug Fix Batch II

### Fixed
- **MAJ-22: Better empty state for season comparison** — Replaced bare "No season data available" text with an informative empty state including a calendar icon, explanation that season-by-season breakdown isn't available, and a note that career totals are shown above.
- **MAJ-23: Improved fallback avatar for players without photos** — Fallback initials now use a consistent slate-blue gradient background (`from-zinc-600 to-zinc-700`), `leading-none` for proper vertical centering, and `select-none` to prevent text selection. This is by design — not all players have photos on Transfermarkt.
- **MAJ-26: GK stats context on player profiles** — Goalkeeper profiles now show relabeled stat cards ("Goals (rare for GK)", "Assists (rare for GK)") with a 🧤 icon, a yellow info banner explaining that saves/clean sheets aren't available from Transfermarkt, and a simplified ratio section showing Min/App instead of Goals/Game. Season table headers also show asterisks for Goals*/Assists* on GK profiles.

## 2026-02-12 (v6) — Bug Fix Batch

### Fixed
- **MAJ-19: Bar graphs use relative scaling instead of fixed 100%** — Comparison bars in `/compare` now use fixed max scales: 500 appearances, 200 goals, 150 assists, 40k minutes for career totals; 60/40/25 for season stats; 1.0 for per-90 ratios. No longer relative to the better player.
- **MAJ-20: Minutes shows 0 for both players** — Minutes data is now computed by summing `minutes` from `season_stats` (or `career_stats.stats_by_season`) when the top-level field is missing. If no minutes data exists for either player, the Minutes row shows "N/A" instead of 0.
- **MAJ-24: "Pressing" appears twice in scout evaluation form** — Renamed duplicate "Pressing" attributes across 5 position templates. Defensive Actions now uses "Counter-Press", Tactical groups use "Pressing Triggers". Affected: Full-Back, Defensive Midfield, Central Midfield, Winger, Centre-Forward.
- **MAJ-25: Player age shows "-" instead of actual age** — `StatBadge` in search page now shows "N/A" for missing age values instead of "-".
- **MAJ-27: "Report done by" auto-fills incorrectly** — Auth callbacks now explicitly pass `name` through JWT→session. GradingForm falls back to email if display name is unavailable.
- **MAJ-28: Merge platform missing "Observe" verdict** — Added "Observe" (teal) to `VERDICT_OPTIONS` between Sign and Monitor. Added to Verdict type, dashboard filter dropdown, VerdictBadge color map, and header stats bar.

## 2026-02-12 (v5)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Grade values resetting to 3** — `gradeToResponse` used `|| 3` / `|| 4` fallback which treated `0` as falsy, overwriting legitimate scout-entered values. Changed all occurrences to nullish coalescing (`?? 3` / `?? 4`) in both `api/grades/[playerId]/route.ts` and `api/grades/route.ts`
- **Position-specific attributes not persisting** — `positionCategory` and `positionAttributes` were only saved to localStorage, never to the database. Added both fields to Prisma schema (`String?` and `Json?`) and wired them through POST, PUT, and GET responses

## 2026-02-12 (v4)

### Added
- **Team Comparison page** (`/compare/teams`) — select two clubs and compare them side by side with aggregated stats from the player database

- **FBRef-style horizontal bar graphs** for all team stats (blue vs red, matching player comparison styling)
- **Full squad lists** — both squads displayed below the graphs with player names, positions, ages, market values, and links to player profiles
- **Team search API** (`GET /api/teams/search?q=`) — returns unique club names matching query (autocomplete)

- **Dashboard navigation** — 🏟️ Teams button added to homepage header
- Dark theme matching existing app (bg-zinc-950, zinc-900 cards, zinc-800 borders)

## 2026-02-12 (v3)
