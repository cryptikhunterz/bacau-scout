| Clearances | 7 | ~28 |
| Tackles | 2 | ~8 |

**MASSIVE clip library for just 12 matches.** 15 pages of defending duels + interceptions = incredibly active defender. 13 pages of aerial duels confirms he dominates in the air at 195cm.

### Key Observations
- **CONTRACT EXPIRED** — potential free agent as of 30/06/2025
- 195cm is massive for any level — anchor CB
- 12 matches at 90 min/match — trusted starter
- 1 headed goal vs Giugliano (3-1, 14/02/2026) — set piece threat CONFIRMED on film
- Only 2 yellows — disciplined for a physical player
- Moldovan-born, Romanian passport — no foreign slot needed
- No agency — negotiate directly
- Recent matches: Catania 4-0 (lost), Giugliano 3-1, Benevento 0-5 — Trapani struggling

### Film Verdict: ⭐⭐ SIGN — #1 Priority Target

**Type of Player:** Giant (195cm) Romanian-passport CB playing in Serie C. Contract expired = potentially FREE. Physical profile + Italian league experience + Romanian passport = dream signing.

**Strengths:**
- 🇷🇴 ROMANIAN PASSPORT — no foreign slot despite being Moldovan
- 📏 **195cm / 6'5"** — aerial monster, tallest CB on the list
- 💰 Contract EXPIRED (30/06/2025) — potentially FREE AGENT
- 🇮🇹 Serie C experience — higher level than Romanian Liga II
- ⏰ Only 23 — youngest abroad CB, massive upside + resale
- 📋 90 min/match — trusted starter
- 🤝 No agent — direct negotiation
- 🎬 CONFIRMED film quality — 15 pages defending duels, 13 pages aerials

**Weaknesses:**
- 📉 Trapani conceding heavily (4-0, 3-1, 0-5) — team quality issue or individual?
- 💪 80kg at 195cm — lean, needs to bulk up
- 🇲🇩 Moldovan birth — cultural adjustment from Italy

**URGENT:** Check if contract has been renewed. If still expired, this is a FREE TRANSFER of a 195cm, 23yo, Romanian-passport CB with Serie C experience. **Make contact immediately.**

| **Goals** | 0 |

| Category | Pages | Est. Clips |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Defending duels | 12 | ~48 |
| Interceptions | 13 | ~52 |
| Aerial duels | 9 | ~36 |
| Clearances | 6 | ~24 |
| Tackles | 1+ | ~4+ (includes Italy career: Messina, international) |
| Passes | 13+ | ~52+ |

### Key Observations
- **LEFT-FOOTED + 192cm** — rare premium combination for a CB
- On loan from **CFR Cluj** — Romania's biggest club. They're developing him.
- Only 9 matches at Voluntari — limited sample but 90min/match (trusted starter when playing)
- 8 interceptions in 9 matches — decent per-90 rate
- Romanian passport (Moldovan birth) — no foreign slot
- CFR Cluj ownership means complicated deal — loan or permanent?
- **Previous career in Italy** (Messina, Foggia) + Moldova national team — tackle clips span multiple clubs
- Film quality is solid — 13 pages of interceptions for 9 matches is elite

### Film Verdict: ⭐ OBSERVE — Premium Physical Profile, Complicated Deal

**Type of Player:** Left-footed giant LCB. The 192cm + left foot + 24yo combination is rare and valuable.

**Strengths:**
- 🦶 **LEFT-FOOTED** — premium CB trait (like Pašagić)
- 📏 **192cm / 6'4"** — aerial dominant
- 🇷🇴 Romanian passport — no foreign slot
- ⏰ 24yo — development potential
- 🏟️ CFR Cluj pedigree — trained at top Romanian club
- 🎬 Strong clip library — 13 pages interceptions, 12 pages def duels
- 🇮🇹 Previous Italian career (Messina, Foggia) + Moldova international

**Weaknesses:**
- 📋 Owned by CFR Cluj — complicated transfer (loan back? permanent fee?)
- 📊 Only 9 matches at Voluntari — very limited sample
- 📉 On loan at Liga II Voluntari — couldn't get into SuperLiga squad
- 💪 81kg at 192cm — needs to bulk up

**IMPORTANT:** If Ceahlăul can negotiate a loan from CFR Cluj, this could be a great low-cost addition. CFR won't sell cheaply but might loan him to get playing time.

## COMBINED CB RANKINGS (SuperLiga + Liga II + Abroad)

### TOP 5 OVERALL

| # | Player | Source | Verdict | Why |
|---|--------|--------|---------|-----|
| 1 | **A. Moțoc** | Abroad (Trapani) | **SIGN** | 195cm, FREE, Romanian passport, Serie C |
| 2 | **A. Dinu** | SuperLiga (Slobozia) | **SIGN** | Romanian, 79% duel rate, reliable |
| 3 | **A. Camara** | SuperLiga (Metaloglobus) | **SIGN** | Elite interceptor, battle-tested, €150K |
| 4 | **M. Bărăitaru** | Liga II (Slatina) | **SIGN** | 19yo, 24 starts, massive potential |
| 5 | **O. Pašagić** | SuperLiga (Metaloglobus) | **SIGN** | FREE, left-footed, ball-playing |

### RECOMMENDED PAIRING FOR CEAHLĂUL

**Option A (Best Overall):** Moțoc (LCB) + Dinu (RCB)
- 195cm aerial monster + reliable dueler = complementary
- Both Romanian passport = 0 foreign slots used
- Moțoc potentially FREE + Dinu ~€150K = total ~€150K

**Option B (Youth Investment):** Bărăitaru (RCB) + Butnărașu (LCB)
- Both under 21, both Romanian = 0 foreign slots
- Long-term investment with resale potential
- Both have goal threat from set pieces

**Option C (Depth):** Sign Moțoc + Dinu as starters, add Butnărașu as young backup
- 3 CBs for minimal cost, all Romanian passport

---

## STILL PENDING
- ⚠️ Bărăitaru — full film clip review (Wyscout search issue with diacritics, have stats + 4 screenshots from scraped data)
- ⚠️ Duțu (Latina) — profile reviewed, film clips NOT reviewed (Events tab issue)
- ⚠️ Potop (AlbinoLeffe) — profile reviewed, film clips NOT reviewed (Events tab issue)

## NOTE ON FILM ACCESS
The workaround for accessing Events/clips: click video category buttons from the sidebar (e.g. "Defending duels") instead of the "Events" tab at the top. The tab click fires but doesn't actually switch the view — it's a Wyscout SPA routing bug. Sidebar category clicks force the page into Events mode correctly. This was discovered after initial frustration with the Events tab and works for all leagues (confirmed: Serie C Italy + Liga II Romania).
