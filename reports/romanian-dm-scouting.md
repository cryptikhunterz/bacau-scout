### 1. R. Sierra
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | R. Sierra |
| **Age** | 29 |
| **Club** | FC Argeș Pitești |
| **Nationality** | 🇪🇸 Spanish |
| **Position** | DMF / LDMF / RCMF / LCMF |
| **Foot** | Right |
| **Height** | 181 cm |
| **Contract/Market Value** | €250K |
| **Minutes Played** | 2,578 (27 matches — most in league) |

**Key Stats (2025/26 Superliga — Per 90):**
- Interceptions: **5.20** per 90 (ranked #28 overall, top for midfielders with high minutes)
- Interceptions Total: **149** (2nd in entire league)
- Aerial Duels Total: **162** (2nd in league)
- Minutes Played: **2,578** (1st in entire league — iron man)

**Film Notes:**
- The league's most durable player — played every single minute. Shows elite stamina and consistency.
- Appears twice in the interceptions table — once with 6.69/90 from 996 minutes (likely first half of season before a data split) and once with 5.20/90 over the full 2,578 minutes.
- Listed as DMF/LDMF/RCMF showing tactical versatility across the midfield base.
- Dominates aerially for a midfielder (162 aerial duels, 2nd in league above most CBs).

**Strengths:**
- 🏋️ Extraordinary durability — never misses games
- 🛡️ Elite interception numbers — reads the game exceptionally
- ✈️ Dominant in aerial duels for a midfielder
- 🔄 Tactical versatility — can play across the defensive midfield line
- 📊 Consistent output over high sample (2,578 mins)

**Weaknesses:**
- ⏰ Age 29 — no resale value, but still 3-4 years of prime
- 🇪🇸 Foreign player — takes a non-Romanian squad slot
- 📉 Argeș is a lower-table team — may inflate defensive numbers slightly
- ❓ No height/weight fully confirmed — limited physical profile data

**Verdict: ⭐ SIGN — Priority Target**
At €250K market value and playing at Argeș (likely affordable wages), Sierra is the clear #1 DM target. His numbers are elite across the board and his durability is unmatched. The Spanish nationality may count against him in squad registration, but his quality justifies it.

### 2. V. Dican
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Valentin Dican |
| **Age** | 25 |
| **Club** | Farul Constanța |
| **Nationality** | 🇷🇴 Romanian |
| **Position** | DMF |
| **Foot** | Right |
| **Height** | 192 cm |
| **Weight** | 81 kg |
| **Contract/Market Value** | €650K |
| **Minutes Played** | 1,488 (20 matches) |

**Key Stats (2025/26 Superliga — Per 90):**
- Interceptions: **6.11** per 90 (6th in league, **#1 among DMFs**)
- Defensive Duels % Success: Among top with Farul's strong defensive system
- 20 matches, 1,488 minutes — regular starter

**Film Notes:**
- Pure DMF — listed only as DMF, no positional versatility needed, this is his home.
- Tall for a DM at 192 cm — unusual profile with aerial threat.
- Romanian nationality is a massive bonus for squad registration.
- Farul is Hagi's project — well-coached team, players are tactically disciplined.
- At 25, he's entering his prime with potential for development.

**Strengths:**
- 🇷🇴 Romanian — no foreign slot needed
- 📈 Prime age (25) — value growth potential
- 📏 Tall (192 cm) — aerial dominance from midfield
- 🛡️ Excellent interception rate (6.11/90) — #1 among pure DMs
- 🏫 Well-coached at Farul (Hagi Academy system)

**Weaknesses:**
- 💰 €650K market value — most expensive on this list, may be out of budget
- 🏟️ Farul is a stable club — unlikely to sell cheaply
- 📊 Fewer minutes than Sierra — slightly smaller sample (1,488 vs 2,578)
- ❓ Need to verify contract situation — if long-term contract, loan unlikely

**Verdict: ⭐ OBSERVE — High-Quality but Expensive**
Dican is the best pure DMF profile in the league by per-90 stats. However, at €650K and playing for Hagi's Farul, he's likely the most expensive and hardest to acquire. Monitor his contract situation — if Farul is willing to loan or if his contract is winding down, he becomes a top target.

### 3. B. Végh

| **Position** | DMF / LDMF / LCMF |
| **Foot** | Right |
| **Contract/Market Value** | Unknown (no listed value) |
| **Minutes Played** | 1,807 (21 matches) |

**Key Stats (2025/26 Superliga — Per 90):**

- Yellow Cards: **8** (2nd in league) — suggests aggressive, ball-winning style

**Film Notes:**
- Plays for Csikszereda, a Hungarian-backed club in Miercurea Ciuc — unique cultural environment.
- DMF/LDMF/LCMF versatility — can shift across the midfield base.
- 8 yellow cards suggests an aggressive, no-nonsense style — exactly what a DM needs.

**Strengths:**
- 🛡️ Aggressive ball-winner (8 yellows = fights for every ball)
- 🔄 Positional versatility across DM positions
- 📊 Good minutes (1,807) — consistent starter
- 💰 No listed market value — potentially affordable
- 🎯 Solid interception rate for a DM

**Weaknesses:**

- ⏰ Age 28 — limited resale value
- ❓ Height/weight unknown — can't assess physicality
- 📉 Csikszereda may be relegation-threatened

**Verdict: ⭐ MONITOR — Affordable Ball-Winner**
Végh is a useful, aggressive DM who could be available cheaply. The yellow card record is a concern but also shows the intensity we need. Worth further investigation of contract details and a scout visit.

**Strengths:**
- 🔄 DM/CB versatility — massive squad value
- 📈 Prime age (25) — room to develop
- 📊 High minutes/consistency
- 💰 €350K — potentially affordable

**Verdict: ⭐ OBSERVE — Versatile Option**
Petro's DM/CB versatility makes him an efficient squad player. At €350K and age 25, he's a smart investment if we need a player who can cover multiple positions. The non-EU slot is the main drawback.

**Film Notes:**

- Kenyan international at UTA Arad — limited minutes (775) suggest rotation/squad player.
- LDMF/RDMF/RCMF — can play across the defensive midfield band.
