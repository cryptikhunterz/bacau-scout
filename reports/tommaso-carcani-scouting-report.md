## 🔍 STANDOUT PERFORMANCES

### Hat-trick vs Foligno Calcio (3-1, 01/02/2026)
- 3 goals (right foot, left foot, right foot) — scored in 5th, 64th, and 70th minutes
- 6/6 shots on target, 0.86 xG match
- Shows ability to score with both feet across different phases of play

### Brace vs Ghiviborgo (2-1, 18/01/2026)
- 1 penalty + 1 open play goal
- 1.25 xG — clinical finishing above expected

### Hat-trick vs San Donato Tavarnelle (3-0, 05/10/2025)
- Left foot, header, penalty — scored all 3 in first half (27th, 33rd, 41st)
- Most diverse goal output: shows he can score in multiple ways

---

## ✅ STRENGTHS

1. **Clinical Finisher** — 14 goals from 11.99 xG (outperforming by +2)
2. **Both Feet** — Scores with right (10), left (6), and head (1). Genuinely two-footed
3. **Penalty Specialist** — Designated taker, 6/6 this season (reliable from the spot)
4. **Early & Late Goals** — Scores in all game phases (5th min to 93rd min)
5. **Volume Shooter** — 2.22 shots/90, actively looking for goal
6. **High Press Striker** — 65.9% of recoveries in opponent's half

## ⚠️ WEAKNESSES

1. **Penalty Dependence** — 43% of goals from the spot; open play output is 8 in 24 games
2. **Weak in Duels** — 36.5% duels won, 35.1% aerial duels — gets physically dominated
3. **Limited Passing** — 74.4% pass accuracy, only 14.56 passes/90 — not a link-up striker
4. **High Ball Losses** — 10.17/90 is concerning, loses possession frequently
5. **Low Assists** — 0.09/90 means he's not creating for others
6. **No Physical Data** — Height/weight unknown, can't assess physical profile
7. **Level of Competition** — Serie D is Italy's 4th tier; all stats must be viewed in that context

## 🎥 VIDEO ANALYSIS

**⚠️ Video unavailable.** The CSM Ceahlăul Wyscout subscription does not include video access for Italian Serie D. All 20 goal clips returned "You don't have permission to view this clip."

Film review was not possible. Recommend obtaining video access or sourcing match footage independently to assess:
- Movement patterns and off-the-ball intelligence
- First touch quality under pressure
- Positioning instincts
- Physical profile and pace
- Pressing intensity and work rate

## 🤔 OVERALL ASSESSMENT

Tommaso Carcani is a natural goalscorer at Italian Serie D level with a genuine two-footed ability that's rare at any level. His 14 goals in 24 appearances looks impressive on paper, but 6 are penalties — his open-play output of 8 goals is more realistic. He outperforms his xG, suggesting clinical finishing or favorable shot selection.

The major concerns are physical. His duel and aerial numbers are poor for a centre-forward (36.5% and 35.1% respectively), which suggests he'd struggle against better, more physical defenders at higher levels. His passing and link-up play are limited — he's a pure poacher-type striker.

At 23 with no agent (per Wyscout), expiring contract in June 2026, and a market value of €125K, he's affordable. But the step up from Serie D to any meaningful level is massive. Without video analysis of his movement, touch, and game intelligence, it's impossible to determine if his qualities would translate.

### Verdict: **OBSERVE**

Worth tracking through the rest of the season, but NOT recommended for signing without:
1. In-person scouting or video review of at least 3 full matches
2. Physical assessment (no height/weight data available)
3. Understanding of why he spent his entire career in Serie D at age 23
