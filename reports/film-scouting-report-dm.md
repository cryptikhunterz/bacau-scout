| **Nationality** | 🇪🇸 Spanish |
| **Height** | 181cm / 5'11" |

| **Goals** | 3 (Superliga) |
| **Yellow/Red** | 2Y / 0R |

### Film Analysis

**Interceptions (15 pages of clips — ELITE volume)**
Sierra's bread and butter. He reads passing lanes exceptionally well, consistently stepping into midfield channels to cut supply lines. From the Petrolul 52 match (13/02/2026), he made 3 interceptions in one half (43:55, 80:01, 87:26). His anticipation is his best trait — he doesn't lunge, he positions himself to intercept.
- 📸 `dm-sierra-interception-vs-petrolul-80min.png` — Sierra reading a pass in the central channel

**Tackles (4 clips only — LOW)**
Only 4 tackle clips across the entire database. This tells a story: Sierra is NOT a crunching tackler. He prefers interceptions and positional intelligence over physical challenges. The tackles he does make are clean — note the 93:41 stoppage-time tackle vs Oțelul showing commitment.
- 📸 `dm-sierra-tackle-vs-otelul-93min.png` — Late commitment in stoppage time

**Defensive Positioning (10 pages — STRONG)**
Consistently flagged by Wyscout for good positional play. Against Steaua București (06/08/2024), Sierra repeatedly occupied the central channel between the lines, denying space. His positioning allows him to intercept rather than tackle — intelligent defending.
- 📸 `dm-sierra-positioning-vs-steaua-58min.png` — Covering central channel

**Passes (14 pages — HIGH volume)**
Sierra is comfortable on the ball. From the Petrolul match, he receives in the half-space with an open body shape, scanning before distributing. He's a tempo-setter rather than a line-breaking passer — his Smart Passes count is very low (only 2 clips total), suggesting safe, reliable distribution.
- 📸 `dm-sierra-passing-vs-petrolul-10min.png` — Composure receiving in midfield

**Smart Passes (2 clips — VERY LOW)**
Only 2 smart pass clips in his career on Wyscout. Sierra is NOT a creative playmaker. He moves the ball efficiently but doesn't split lines. For a DM, this is acceptable but worth noting.

**Goals (4 clips — GOOD for a DM)**
3 right-foot goals and 1 header. The header vs Oțelul (64:23) shows aerial ability despite modest height. Against U Cluj (64:55), he timed a late run into the box well. Against CFR Cluj (41:08) — scoring vs a top-table team shows composure.
- 📸 `dm-sierra-goal-vs-ucluj-65min.png` — Late arriving run into the box

### Film Verdict: ⭐ SIGN

**Type of Player:** Positional DM / Interceptor — in the mold of a Sergio Busquets lite. Reads the game, positions himself to intercept, distributes safely, rarely commits fouls (only 2 yellows). NOT a physical destroyer.

**Strengths from Film:**
- 🧠 Elite reading of the game — 15 pages of interception clips
- 📍 Excellent positional discipline — rarely out of position
- ⚽ Composed on the ball — 14 pages of passing clips
- 🎯 Goal threat from late runs — 3 goals from DM
- 🟡 Very clean player — only 2 yellows in 27 matches
- 📋 Iron-man durability — 88.4 min/match average

**Weaknesses from Film:**
- 💪 Not physical — only 4 tackles, won't bully midfielders
- 🎨 Not creative — 2 smart passes total
- 🏃 Height (181cm) — may struggle aerially vs bigger midfielders
- 📋 Contract appears expired — could be complications
- 🇪🇸 Foreign slot required

**Recommendation:** Top target for a DM who controls space through intelligence rather than physicality. His expired contract makes him potentially a FREE transfer — massive value. The 15 pages of interceptions vs 4 tackles tells you everything about his style.

## 2. V. DICAN — Farul Constanța (🇷🇴 Romania, 25, DMF/LDMF)

### Profile
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Dican Victor |
| **Birth Date** | 11/10/2000 (25 y.o.) |
| **Club** | Farul Constanța |
| **Nationality** | 🇷🇴 Romanian |
| **Height** | 192cm / 6'4" |
| **Weight** | 81kg / 178lbs |
| **Foot** | Right |
| **Contract** | 30/06/2027 |
| **Agent** | No agency |
| **Market Value** | ~€200K |
| **Matches** | 20 Superliga (1,364 mins) + 3 Cupa României (252 mins) |
| **Goals** | 1 |
| **Yellow/Red** | 7Y / 1R |

### Film Analysis

**Interceptions (15 pages — ELITE)**
Same massive volume as Sierra. Dican reads passing lanes well but from a more physical starting point. Against Rapid București (15/02/2026, 3-1 win), he made multiple interceptions across the half — clips at 32:32, 41:38, 50:14, 57:18 in a single match. His long legs help him cover more ground per interception attempt.
- 📸 `dm-dican-interception-vs-rapid-32min.png` — Cutting a passing lane at 32:32

**Defending Duels (15 pages — ELITE)**
This is where Dican separates from Sierra. Massive physical presence at 192cm. Against Petrolul (25/01/2026), he was engaged in ground duels constantly throughout the match. His disciplinary record (7Y, 1R) shows he's aggressive — sometimes too aggressive. But the volume of defending duel clips confirms he's combative.
- 📸 `dm-dican-defending-duel-vs-petrolul-79min.png` — Physical battle at 79th minute

**Aerial Duels (15 pages — ELITE)**
At 192cm, Dican is a monster in the air. Against Rapid, he won multiple aerial contests in both halves. Against Unirea Slobozia, he had 13 aerial duel clips in a single match. For a DM, this aerial dominance is exceptional — he wins virtually every first ball from goal kicks and long clearances.
- 📸 `dm-dican-aerial-duel-vs-rapid-23min.png` — Winning an aerial contest at 23:06

### Film Verdict: ⭐ SIGN — Priority Romanian DM

**Type of Player:** Physical Destroyer / Box-to-Box DM. The polar opposite of Sierra — Dican dominates through physicality rather than intelligence. At 192cm, he's the tallest DM on this list and wins everything in the air.

**Strengths from Film:**
- 💪 Physically dominant — 192cm, wins aerial duels easily
- 🇷🇴 ROMANIAN — no foreign slot needed (MASSIVE advantage)
- 🎯 15 pages each of interceptions + defending duels + aerial duels — elite defensive volume
- 📈 Young (25) — prime years ahead, resale potential
- ⚡ Farul Constanța — step up from most targets, proves quality
- 🏋️ Combative — never backs down from a challenge

**Weaknesses from Film:**
- 🟡 Discipline — 7 yellows and 1 red in 20 matches is VERY high
- 🦶 Limited on the ball — fewer passing clips than Sierra
- 📋 Contract until 2027 — Farul will demand a fee
- 🧠 Less positional intelligence than Sierra — relies on physicality
- 68.2 min/match — not always playing full 90s (subbed out or late sub?)

**Recommendation:** PRIORITY signing over Sierra due to being Romanian (saves a foreign slot). His physical profile is perfect for Liga 1's aggressive style. The discipline issue needs monitoring — 7Y/1R is borderline, but controlled aggression is an asset. Farul's contract until 2027 means a transfer fee will be needed.

## 3. B. VÉGH — Csikszereda Miercurea Ciuc (🇭🇺 Hungary, 28, DMF/LCMF)

### Profile
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Végh Bence |
| **Birth Date** | 13/05/1997 (28 y.o.) |
| **Club** | Csikszereda Miercurea Ciuc |
| **Nationality** | 🇭🇺 Hungarian |
| **Foot** | Right |
| **Contract** | 30/06/2026 (expiring!) |
| **Agent** | No agency |
| **Market Value** | ~€150K |
| **Matches** | 21 Superliga (1,666 mins) + 3 Cupa României (252 mins) |
| **Goals** | 0 |
| **Yellow/Red** | 8Y / 0R |

### Film Analysis

**Defending Duels (15 pages — ELITE)**
Végh is the most aggressive DM on this list. 8 yellows in 21 matches = a card every 2.6 games. Against UTA Arad (07/02/2026), he was constantly in the face of opposition midfielders, pressing high and engaging early. His defending duel volume (15 pages) confirms he's a relentless closer of space.
- 📸 `dm-vegh-defending-duel-vs-uta-12min.png` — Aggressive pressing at 12:17

**Interceptions (15 pages — ELITE)**
Végh's interception volume matches his duel volume — 15 pages each. Against UTA Arad (21:31), Metaloglobus (08:00, 39:52, 45:57). He reads passing lanes effectively AND closes space — a rare dual-threat DM who both anticipates and engages.
- 📸 `dm-vegh-interception-vs-uta-22min.png` — Stepping into passing lane vs UTA

**Passes (14 pages — STRONG)**
14 pages of passing clips shows Végh is involved in build-up play. Against UTA (02:30, 04:44, 04:56, 07:35) — he distributes from the first minute. Not just a destroyer — he circulates the ball competently.
- 📸 `dm-vegh-passing-vs-uta-3min.png` — Early distribution in build-up

**Aerial Duels (15 pages — ELITE)**
Against Botoșani (27:06, 34:48, 56:16), CFR Cluj (39:40, 55:58, 69:01, 80:57), Argeș (15:44, 93:32), Slobozia (13:24, 40:51, 57:36, 61:53). 15 pages is the maximum tier — despite unknown height, he clearly wins aerial battles consistently. This is a surprise — he may be taller than expected.
- 📸 `dm-vegh-aerial-duel-vs-botosani-35min.png` — Contesting aerial duel at Botoșani

### Film Verdict: ⭐ OBSERVE — Expiring Contract Watch

**Type of Player:** Aggressive Ball-Winner. Végh presses, closes, and fouls. His yellow card rate is the highest on the list (8Y in 21 matches = one every 208 minutes). He's a disruptor, not a controller.

**Strengths from Film:**
- 📋 Contract expires 30/06/2026 — FREE in summer
- 💪 Extremely combative — 15 pages of defending duels
- 🎓 Liga 1 experienced — 21 starts, knows the league
- ⚡ Csikszereda plays aggressive style — comfortable pressing

**Weaknesses from Film:**
- 🟡 DISCIPLINE CRISIS — 8 yellows in 21 matches, borderline suspension risk every game
- 🇭🇺 Foreign slot needed — and he's 28, limited upside
- 📊 Zero goals — no offensive threat
- 📉 Height/weight unknown — physical profile unclear
- ⏰ Age 28 — no resale value

**Recommendation:** Monitor as a free transfer option in summer 2026. His aggression is an asset but the discipline record is a genuine concern. At 28 with no resale value, he's a short-term depth signing only. Sierra or Dican should be prioritized.

## 4. C. PETRO — FC Botoșani (🇲🇼 Malawi, 25, DMF/LDMF)

### Profile
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Petro John Charles |
| **Birth Date** | 08/02/2001 (25 y.o.) |
| **Club** | FC Botoșani |
| **Nationality** | 🇲🇼 Malawian |
| **Height** | 176cm / 5'9" |
| **Weight** | 70kg / 154lbs |
| **Foot** | Right |
| **Contract** | 30/06/2028 (long contract!) |
| **Agent** | No agency |
| **Market Value** | ~€350K |
| **Matches** | 23 Superliga (2,008 mins) + 1 Cupa (46 mins) |
| **Goals** | 1 (right foot) + 1 (header — from previous season) |
| **Yellow/Red** | 4Y / 0R |

### Film Analysis

**Interceptions (15 pages — ELITE)**
Petro's reading of the game is exceptional. Against UTA Arad (15/02/2026), he intercepted at 01:08, 02:40, 05:07, 11:20 — FOUR interceptions in the opening 12 minutes. He doesn't wait for danger to arrive, he goes hunting for it.
- 📸 `dm-petro-interception-vs-uta-1min.png` — Intercepting from kickoff

**Defending Duels (15 pages — ELITE)**
Against UTA Arad (35:05, 67:23), Metaloglobus (08:53, 11:57), FCS București. Despite being only 176cm/70kg, Petro engages physically and wins. 15 pages is the maximum tier — matching Dican and Végh who are both bigger.
- 📸 `dm-petro-defending-duel-vs-uta-35min.png` — Winning duel despite smaller frame

**Passes (13 pages — STRONG)**
Against UTA (04:09, 08:06, 10:27, 14:14). Petro is actively involved in build-up from the first whistle. 13 pages shows he's a two-way DM — defending AND distributing, similar to Sierra but with more physicality.
- 📸 `dm-petro-passing-vs-uta-4min.png` — Distributing from deep

**Goals (2 clips)**
Goal vs Hermannstadt (27:00 — right foot, 27/10/2025) and vs Argeș (62:50 — header, 04/12/2024). A DM who can score with both feet AND head. The header especially is impressive for a 176cm player.
- 📸 `dm-petro-goal-vs-hermannstadt-27min.png` — Clinical finish vs Hermannstadt

### Film Verdict: ⭐ SIGN — Complete Two-Way DM

**Type of Player:** Complete Box-to-Box DM. Petro does EVERYTHING — intercepts (15 pages), wins duels (15 pages), passes (13 pages), and scores goals. At 176cm/70kg he shouldn't be winning this many duels, but he compensates with intensity and timing.

**Strengths from Film:**
- 🧠 Elite reading — 4 interceptions in 12 minutes vs UTA
- 💪 Wins duels despite small frame — heart of a lion
- 🎯 Scores goals (foot + header) — offensive threat from DM
- 📊 Massive sample — 23 matches, 2,008 mins, iron-man
- 📈 Young (25) — prime years ahead
- 🟡 Clean discipline — 4Y/0R in 23 matches

**Weaknesses from Film:**
- 🇲🇼 Non-EU foreign slot needed
- 📏 Undersized (176cm/70kg) — aerial vulnerability
- 💰 €350K + contract until 2028 — Botoșani has leverage
- 📋 Botoșani won't sell cheap with that contract length

**Recommendation:** Petro is arguably the best all-round DM on this list. His film profile is stacked — elite in every defensive category despite being the smallest player reviewed. The main barriers are price (€350K) and contract length (2028). If Ceahlăul can afford it, he's a top signing. If not, he's a "monitor for loan" target.
