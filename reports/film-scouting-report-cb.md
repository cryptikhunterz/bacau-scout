## 1. A. CAMARA — FC Metaloglobus (🇫🇷 France, 25, CB)

### Profile
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Camara Aboubacar |
| **Birth Date** | 05/01/2001 (25 y.o.) |
| **Club** | Metaloglobus București (on loan) |
| **Owner** | U Craiova 1948 |
| **Nationality** | 🇫🇷 French |
| **Height** | 190cm / 6'3" |
| **Weight** | 80kg / 176lbs |
| **Foot** | Right |
| **Contract** | 30/06/2026 (at U Craiova) |
| **Agent** | No agency |
| **Market Value** | ~€150K |
| **Matches** | 16 Superliga (1,261 mins) + 1 Cupa României (90 mins) |
| **Goals** | 0 |
| **Yellow/Red** | 5Y / 1R |

### Film Analysis

**Interceptions (15 pages — ELITE)**
Camara's defining trait. Against Csikszereda (04/02/2026), he intercepted 4 passes in 10 minutes (24:26, 31:33, 34:43, 36:40). His reading of the game is exceptional — he steps out from the defensive line to cut passing lanes proactively. At 190cm, his long legs give him extra reach on interception attempts.

**1 vs 1 Defense (5 pages — GOOD)**
Camara holds his ground well in 1v1 situations. Against Argeș (23/01/2026), he was tested 3 times in the opening 25 minutes (04:35, 11:09, 25:54) and maintained good body position throughout. He doesn't dive in — stays on his feet, forces attackers wide.
- 📸 `cb-camara-1v1-defense-vs-arges-5min.png` — Solid body shape, staying balanced

**Key Observation: Metaloglobus Context**
Metaloglobus is bottom of the table. Camara faces MORE attacks per match than a CB at FCSB or CFR. His stats are partly volume-inflated, BUT he's also battle-tested — defending under constant pressure builds resilience. His individual quality shines through despite the team's struggles.

### Film Verdict: ⭐ SIGN — Best Value CB

**Type of Player:** Proactive Interceptor / Reading CB. Camara anticipates rather than reacts. His interception rate (6.26/90 — 5th in the league) is backed up by what you see on film: he steps out aggressively, reads passes early, and recovers well.

**Strengths from Film:**
- 🧠 Elite reading of the game — 15 pages of interception clips in only 16 matches
- 💪 Good 1v1 defender — stays on feet, doesn't dive in
- 📏 Physical profile (190cm, 80kg) — aerially competitive
- 📈 Young (25) — prime years ahead, potential resale
- ⚔️ Battle-tested — constant defensive workload at Metaloglobus
- 💰 Affordable (~€150K) — Metaloglobus/Craiova will sell

**Weaknesses from Film:**
- 🇫🇷 Foreign slot needed
- 🟡 5 yellows + 1 red in 16 matches — discipline needs improvement
- 📉 Playing at bottom club — can he step up?
- 📋 On loan from U Craiova — complicated deal structure
- ❓ Only 16 matches — limited sample

**Recommendation:** Top CB target. His interception volume is genuinely elite — not just stats, the film confirms it. The loan from Craiova means negotiation will be with them. Foreign slot is the main concern.

## 2. O. PAŠAGIĆ — FC Metaloglobus (🇧🇦 Bosnia, 28, LCB)

### Profile
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Pašagić Omar |
| **Birth Date** | 11/10/1997 (28 y.o.) |
| **Club** | Metaloglobus București |
| **Nationality** | 🇧🇦 Bosnian |
| **Height** | 188cm / 6'2" |
| **Foot** | LEFT |
| **Contract** | EXPIRED (30/06/2025) — FREE AGENT |
| **Agent** | No agency |
| **Market Value** | ~€50K |
| **Matches** | 12 Superliga (1,013 mins) + 2 Cupa României (180 mins) |
| **Goals** | 0 |
| **Yellow/Red** | 1Y / 0R |

### Film Analysis

**Interceptions (9 pages — STRONG for 12 matches)**
Pašagić's interception volume is impressive relative to his playing time. Against CFR Cluj (30/01/2026, 4-2 loss), he made 5+ interceptions (clips at 39:02, 61:22, 63:24, 70:55) — even in a game where his team conceded 4. He reads the game similarly to Camara (his CB partner) but from the LEFT side.
- 📸 `cb-pasagic-interception-vs-cfr-39min.png` — Stepping up to intercept vs CFR

**Defending Duels (6 pages — MODERATE)**
Against CFR Cluj (30/01/2026, 4-2 loss), Pašagić engaged in clean duels — clips at 42:11, plus vs Argeș (57:21) and Rapid (56:56, 64:57). He's not a physical destroyer but holds his ground through positioning rather than strength.
- 📸 `cb-pasagic-defending-duel-vs-cfr-42min.png` — Engaging attacker, maintaining balance

**Aerial Duels (5 pages — ADEQUATE)**
Against Argeș (23/01/2026, 0-2) clips at 04:05, 24:05, 41:20 — and Rapid (40:03). At 188cm he's aerially competitive but not dominant. 5 pages in 12 matches is moderate — he picks his aerial battles wisely rather than contesting everything.
- 📸 `cb-pasagic-aerial-duel-vs-arges-4min.png` — Contesting early aerial duel

**Passes (13 pages — EXCELLENT for a CB)**
This is where Pašagić stands out. 13 pages of passing clips for a CB in 12 matches is exceptional. Against CFR Cluj he was involved in build-up from the very first minute (05:46, 06:02, 06:18, 08:26). His left foot gives Metaloglobus a natural outlet on the left side.
- 📸 `cb-pasagic-passing-vs-cfr-6min.png` — Building from the back at CFR

**Unique Video Categories:**
Pašagić has unusual clip categories for a CB: **Key Passes, Accelerations, Crosses, Off the Ball Movements**. This confirms he's a ball-playing CB with more attacking involvement than a typical defender.

**Discipline:**
Only 1 yellow card in 14 matches total — extremely clean defender. This contrasts sharply with his partner Camara (5Y/1R). Pašagić defends without fouling.

### Film Verdict: ⭐ SIGN — Bargain Free Agent LCB

**Type of Player:** Ball-Playing Left-Footed CB. Pašagić reads the game, plays with his left foot (rare premium), and brings the ball forward. His unique video categories suggest more progressive defending than a typical stopper.

**Strengths from Film:**
- 🦶 LEFT-FOOTED — rare, premium CB trait
- 💰 FREE AGENT — contract expired, zero transfer fee
- 🧠 Good reading — 9 pages of interceptions in 12 matches
- 🟢 Extremely clean — 1 yellow in 14 matches
- 🎨 Ball-playing ability — unusual video categories suggest progressive defender
- 🤝 Knows Camara — could sign both as a partnership

**Weaknesses from Film:**
- 🇧🇦 Foreign slot needed
- ⏰ Age 28 — no resale value
- ⚠️ Only 12 matches — very limited sample
- 📉 Metaloglobus quality — bottom of table
- ❓ Why is his contract expired and he's still playing? — investigate

**Recommendation:** Sign as a FREE AGENT to pair with Camara. Left-footed CB with clean discipline and ball-playing ability. The fact he's free makes this a no-brainer depth signing even if he's not a guaranteed starter.

## 3. A. DINU — Unirea Slobozia (🇷🇴 Romania, 27, RCB)

### Profile
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Dinu Alexandru Ionuț |
| **Birth Date** | 08/04/1998 (27 y.o.) |
| **Club** | Unirea Slobozia |
| **Nationality** | 🇷🇴 Romanian |
| **Foot** | Right |
| **Contract** | 30/06/2026 (expiring) |
| **Agent** | No agency |
| **Market Value** | ~€150K |
| **Matches** | 20 Superliga (1,727 mins) |
| **Goals** | 0 |
| **Yellow/Red** | 5Y / 0R |

### Film Analysis

**Defending Duels (10 pages — STRONG)**
Dinu is a consistent, no-nonsense defender. Against Farul Constanța (07/02/2026, 2-1 win), he won his duel at 56:48 with clean body positioning — staying on his feet and using his frame effectively. His 79.10% duel success rate (4th in the league) is confirmed on film: he rarely gets beaten.
- 📸 `cb-dinu-defending-duel-vs-farul-57min.png` — Solid stance, winning a duel on the right side

**Interceptions (15 pages — ELITE)**
A surprise find on film. Against Dinamo București (16/02/2026, 1-0 loss), Dinu made multiple interceptions in the second half (47:20, 47:27, 52:33, 60:41). 15 pages is the maximum seen — matching Camara and Hegedűs. This elevates him from "just a dueler" to a complete defender who reads AND fights.
- 📸 `cb-dinu-interception-vs-dinamo-47min.png` — Stepping out to cut a pass vs Dinamo

**Aerial Duels (15 pages — ELITE)**
Against Dinamo (58:28, 59:02) and Farul (40:10, 52:04), Dinu dominates in the air. 15 pages is the maximum tier — same as Dican in the DM list. Despite unknown height, he clearly has the physical tools to win aerial battles consistently.
- 📸 `cb-dinu-aerial-duel-vs-dinamo-58min.png` — Winning an aerial challenge vs Dinamo

**Clearances (9 pages — STRONG)**
Regular danger-clearing: clips vs Dinamo (47:20), Farul (06:32, 07:02, 80:11, 89:11), UTA (21:38, 84:12). He doesn't overthink clearances — sees danger, gets it out.
- 📸 `cb-dinu-clearance-vs-dinamo-47min.png` — Decisive clearance under pressure

**Reliability:**
Dinu's biggest selling point on film is his CONSISTENCY. 20 matches, 1,727 minutes, 86.4 min/match average. He plays through everything. The 5 yellows show he's physical but controlled — no reds ever.

### Film Verdict: ⭐ SIGN — Priority Romanian CB

**Type of Player:** Reliable, Consistent RCB. Dinu isn't flashy — he's the CB who always starts, always finishes, and rarely gets beaten in a duel. His Romanian nationality is his biggest asset.

**Strengths from Film:**
- 🇷🇴 ROMANIAN — no foreign slot, massive advantage
- 🛡️ Elite duel success (79.10% — 4th in league)
- 📊 Excellent sample (20 matches, 1,727 mins)
- 💰 Affordable (~€150K) + expiring contract
- 📋 Iron-man reliability — 86.4 min/match
- 🟡 Clean discipline — 5Y, 0R

**Weaknesses from Film:**
- ❓ Height/weight unknown — can't verify physical profile
- 📊 Not an elite interceptor — relies more on duels
- 📉 Unirea Slobozia — lower-table quality
- ⏰ Age 27 — limited resale value
- 🏃 Not tested at higher level

**Recommendation:** PRIORITY signing due to Romanian nationality. Saves a foreign slot that can be used on Camara or Sierra. Solid, reliable, affordable. Make this the first call.

## 4. J. HEGEDŰS — Csikszereda (🇭🇺 Hungary, 29, LCB/RCB)

### Profile
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Hegedűs János |
| **Birth Date** | 04/10/1996 (29 y.o.) |
| **Club** | Csikszereda Miercurea Ciuc |
| **Nationality** | 🇭🇺 Hungarian |
| **Height** | 189cm / 6'2" |
| **Weight** | 81kg / 178lbs |
| **Foot** | Right |
| **Contract** | 30/06/2026 (expiring) |
| **Agent** | No agency |
| **Market Value** | ~€75K |
| **Matches** | 17 Superliga (1,484 mins) + 2 Cupa (180 mins) |
| **Goals** | 0 |
| **Yellow/Red** | 0Y / 0R — ZERO CARDS |

### Film Analysis

**Interceptions (15 pages — ELITE)**
Against Sporting Lieşti (11/02/2026 Cupa, 0-5 win) at 52:18, 65:32, 81:10. Also vs Rapid (16:20). 15 pages for 17+2 matches — elite reading. Hegedűs anticipates passes well and steps out confidently.
- 📸 `cb-hegedus-interception-vs-liesti-52min.png` — Intercepting comfortably in cup match

**Defending Duels (11 pages — STRONG)**
Against Rapid București (28/11/2025, 4-1 loss) at 08:43, 41:52, 42:54. Also vs Slobozia (25:14). 11 pages shows he's frequently engaged in physical duels despite the team conceding 4 to Rapid.
- 📸 `cb-hegedus-defending-duel-vs-rapid-9min.png` — Engaging in early duel at Rapid

**Aerial Duels (7 pages — ADEQUATE)**
Against Lieşti (86:09), Rapid (71:20), Dinamo (05:48, 45:48). At 189cm he contests aerials but isn't dominant — 7 pages is lower than Dinu (15) or Né Lopes (11).
- 📸 `cb-hegedus-aerial-duel-vs-liesti-86min.png` — Aerial contest in cup

**Key Finding:** Also played vs Ceahlăul Piatra Neamț (3-1, 04/08/2024) — club has direct knowledge of him!

### Film Verdict: ⭐ OBSERVE — Cheap Expiring Option

**Type of Player:** Clean, Reading CB. Zero cards in 19 matches is extraordinary. Hegedűs defends intelligently without ever needing to foul — the cleanest defender in this entire report.

**Strengths from Film:**
- 🟢 ZERO cards in 19 matches — unheard-of discipline
- 🧠 Elite interception rate (15 pages)
- 💰 €75K + expiring contract = very cheap
- 📏 189cm/81kg — adequate physical profile
- 🤝 Teammate of Végh — could negotiate package deal
- 📋 LCB/RCB versatile

**Weaknesses from Film:**
- 🇭🇺 Foreign slot needed
- ⏰ Age 29 — zero resale value
- ✈️ Aerial duels only adequate (7 pages)
- 📉 Csikszereda conceded 4 to Rapid with him playing

**Verdict: OBSERVE** — cheap depth signing if foreign slot is available. His zero-card discipline is unique.

## 5. NÉ LOPES — Oțelul Galați (🇵🇹 Portugal, 25, RCB/LCB)

### Profile
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Cunha Lopes Manuel Alberto |
| **Birth Date** | 29/05/2000 (25 y.o.) |
| **Club** | Oțelul Galați |
| **Nationality** | 🇵🇹 Portuguese |
| **Height** | 185cm / 6'1" |
| **Weight** | 77kg / 169lbs |
| **Foot** | Right |
| **Contract** | 30/06/2027 |
| **Agent** | No agency |
| **Market Value** | ~€250K |
| **Matches** | 12 Superliga (812 mins) + 1 Cupa (90 mins) |
| **Goals** | 0 |
| **Yellow/Red** | 1Y / 0R |

### Film Analysis

**Interceptions (12 pages — STRONG for 812 mins)**
Against Metaloglobus (14/02/2026, 0-1 win), Né Lopes intercepted at 11:54, 49:40, 60:03, 61:11 — 4 interceptions in one match. 12 pages in only 812 minutes gives him arguably the highest per-90 interception rate of any CB on this list.
- 📸 `cb-nelopes-interception-vs-metaloglobus-12min.png` — Stepping to intercept in build-up

**Defending Duels (8 pages — GOOD for 812 mins)**
Against Metaloglobus (48:08, 51:24, 53:25, 71:02). Solid engagement despite his lighter frame (77kg). He's not a bruiser but uses positioning and timing to win duels.
- 📸 `cb-nelopes-defending-duel-vs-metaloglobus-48min.png` — Winning duel on the right side

**Aerial Duels (11 pages — IMPRESSIVE for 185cm)**
Against Metaloglobus (33:54, 45:09, 91:16) and U Cluj (61:16). 11 pages at only 185cm/77kg is remarkable — he jumps well and times his challenges, compensating for lack of height with technique.
- 📸 `cb-nelopes-aerial-duel-vs-metaloglobus-34min.png` — Contesting aerial despite size

### Film Verdict: ⭐ OBSERVE — High Ceiling, Low Minutes

**Type of Player:** Technical, Intelligent CB from a well-coached team. Oțelul plays organized football and Né Lopes fits that mold — smart positioning, good interception timing, aerially brave despite limited size.

**Strengths from Film:**
- 📈 Young (25) — prime years ahead, potential resale
- 🧠 Highest per-90 interception rate on the list (12 pages in 812 mins)
- ✈️ Surprisingly strong aerial presence (11 pages at 185cm)
- 🟢 Very clean — 1Y/0R
- 🏟️ Well-coached club background (Oțelul)

**Weaknesses from Film:**
- 🇵🇹 Foreign slot needed
- 📉 Only 812 mins — very limited sample (9 starts)
- 💰 €250K — more expensive than alternatives
- 📏 Undersized (185cm/77kg) — physical limitation
- 📋 Contract until 2027 — Oțelul has leverage
- ❓ Not a regular starter — why?

**Verdict: OBSERVE** — monitor if he becomes a regular starter. If Oțelul would loan him, that's ideal. Currently too expensive and unproven for a mid-table Liga 1 club to invest in.
