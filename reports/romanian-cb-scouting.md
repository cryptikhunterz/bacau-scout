## 🟢 TOP 5 CENTRE-BACK PROSPECTS

---

### 1. A. Camara
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | A. Camara |
| **Age** | 25 |
| **Club** | FC Metaloglobus București |
| **Nationality** | 🇫🇷 French |
| **Position** | CB / RCB |
| **Foot** | Right |
| **Height** | 190 cm |
| **Weight** | 80 kg |
| **Contract/Market Value** | €150K |
| **Minutes Played** | 1,366 (16 matches) |

**Key Stats (2025/26 Superliga — Per 90):**
- Interceptions: **6.26** per 90 (5th in entire league — elite)
- Among top defensive players at a relegation-threatened club
- 16 matches started — regular when available

**Film Notes:**
- Playing for Metaloglobus (bottom of table) — his defensive stats are inflated by the team being under constant pressure, BUT it also means he's battle-tested under fire.
- French CB at 190 cm — good physical profile for Liga 1.
- 6.26 interceptions per 90 is an exceptional number — 5th in the entire league across all positions.
- €150K market value is very affordable — Metaloglobus is likely a seller.
- Only 16 matches (1,366 mins) — need to check if injury or late arrival.

**Strengths:**
- 🛡️ Elite interception rate (6.26/90 — top 5 in league)
- 💰 Very affordable (€150K) — Metaloglobus will sell
- 📏 Good size (190 cm, 80 kg) — aerially strong
- 📈 Young (25) — prime years ahead, potential resale
- ⚔️ Battle-tested — playing at a struggling club builds character

**Weaknesses:**
- 🇫🇷 Foreign player — takes a non-Romanian slot
- 📉 Metaloglobus quality — are his numbers real or just high volume?
- ⚠️ Only 16 matches — need to check availability/fitness
- ❓ Playing at bottom-table club — step up in quality needed?
- 1 red card — discipline question (minor)

**Verdict: ⭐ SIGN — Best Value CB Target**
Camara offers elite per-90 defensive numbers at a bargain price. At 25, he has resale potential. The foreign slot is the main drawback, but his quality-to-price ratio is the best on this list. Metaloglobus likely faces relegation, making him available.

### 2. O. Pašagić
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | O. Pašagić |
| **Age** | 28 |
| **Club** | FC Metaloglobus București |
| **Nationality** | 🇧🇦 Bosnian |
| **Position** | LCB / CB |
| **Foot** | Left |
| **Height** | 188 cm |
| **Contract/Market Value** | €50K |
| **Minutes Played** | 1,102 (12 matches) |

**Key Stats (2025/26 Superliga — Per 90):**
- Interceptions: **5.96** per 90 (8th in league)
- Defensive Duels % Success: ~79% range (top tier)
- Left-footed CB — rare and valuable

**Film Notes:**
- LEFT-FOOTED CB — this is a premium attribute. Most teams are desperate for left-footed centre-backs.
- Bosnian international at Metaloglobus — dirt cheap at €50K.
- 188 cm — good height for a CB, strong in the air.
- Playing LCB — perfect for a left-sided CB role in a 3-back or left CB in a 4.
- Metaloglobus partnership with Camara could be explored — sign both?
- Only 12 matches — limited minutes, need to check why.

**Strengths:**
- 🦶 LEFT-FOOTED — rare, premium CB trait
- 💰 Incredibly cheap (€50K) — virtually free
- 🛡️ Strong interception rate (5.96/90)
- 📏 Good size (188 cm)
- 🇧🇦 Bosnian — potentially EU passport or easy work permit

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ Only 12 matches (1,102 mins) — very limited sample
- 📉 Metaloglobus quality concerns
- ⏰ Age 28 — no resale value
- 🇧🇦 Foreign slot needed
- ❓ Weight unknown — can't assess full physical profile

**Verdict: ⭐ SIGN — Bargain Left-Footed CB**
At €50K, Pašagić is essentially free. A left-footed CB is always in demand. Even if he's a rotation option, the price is too good to pass up. Can partner with Camara — potentially sign both from Metaloglobus.

**Verdict: ⭐ SIGN — Priority Romanian CB**
Dinu is THE Romanian CB target. No foreign slot needed, elite duel success, affordable price, proven at Liga 1 level. Should be the first call we make for CB recruitment.

- ❓ Not elite — solid but not top-tier

**Verdict: ⭐ MONITOR — Cheap Experienced Option**
Hegedűs is a reliable, experienced CB who won't cost much. Ideal as a squad depth signing rather than a starter. If we need an affordable, experienced head for the dressing room, he's the guy.

### 5. Né Lopes
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Né Lopes |
| **Age** | 25 |
| **Club** | SC Oțelul Galați |
| **Nationality** | 🇵🇹 Portuguese |
| **Position** | LCB / RCB |
| **Foot** | Right |
| **Height** | 185 cm |
| **Weight** | 77 kg |
| **Contract/Market Value** | €250K |
| **Minutes Played** | 900 (12 matches) |

**Key Stats (2025/26 Superliga — Per 90):**
- Interceptions: **5.60** per 90 (15th in league)
- Playing alongside M. Zhelev (one of the best defenders in the league)
- LCB/RCB versatility

**Film Notes:**
- Portuguese CB at Oțelul — well-coached team under Dorinel Munteanu.
- Playing next to M. Zhelev (league leader in defensive duels) — learning from one of the best.
- 185 cm is slightly shorter for a CB but 77 kg is lean — may be more of a ball-playing CB.
- 25 years old — good development age with potential resale.
- Only 12 matches/900 minutes — rotation player, competing for a spot.
- €250K — moderate price, Oțelul is a selling club.

**Strengths:**
- 📈 Young (25) — development and resale potential
- 🛡️ Good interception rate (5.60/90)
- 🏫 Well-coached at Oțelul — tactical education
- 🔄 LCB/RCB versatility
- 🇵🇹 EU passport — easier registration

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ Only 900 minutes — limited sample, rotation player
- 📏 Shorter for a CB (185 cm) — aerial concerns
- 💰 €250K — not cheap for limited minutes
- ❓ Why isn't he starting regularly at Oțelul?

**Verdict: ⭐ OBSERVE — Young Ball-Playing CB**
Lopes has an interesting profile — young, Portuguese, from a well-coached team. But the limited minutes are a concern. Worth monitoring — if he becomes a regular starter, he jumps up the list. If Oțelul is willing to loan him for experience, that's ideal.
